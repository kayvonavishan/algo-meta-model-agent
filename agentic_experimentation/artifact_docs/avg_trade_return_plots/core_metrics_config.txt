Shape:
- A "row-metric table":
  - Index (first column) is the row key (metric name).
  - Remaining columns are metric values for different portfolios/universes.

Columns:
- (index): metric row key (string)
- all_models: metrics for the baseline universe ("all models/strategies")
- topN: metrics for the meta-selected universe ("top N models/strategies")

Row keys (metric definitions):
- n_periods: number of evaluation periods used
- mean_return: arithmetic mean period return
- median_return: median period return
- volatility: standard deviation of period returns
- sharpe: (mean_return / volatility) * sqrt(periods_per_year); higher is better
- sortino: (mean_return / downside_std) * sqrt(periods_per_year); higher is better
- hit_rate: fraction of periods with positive return
- cagr: compounded annual growth rate (computed from the equity curve); higher is better
- calmar: cagr / abs(max_drawdown); higher is better (requires max_drawdown < 0)
- p05_return: 5th percentile of period returns (more negative is worse)
- cvar_05: mean of returns in the worst 5% tail (more negative is worse)
- max_drawdown: worst drawdown from running equity peak (typically negative; closer to 0 is better)
- avg_drawdown_depth: average drawdown depth during drawdown periods (typically negative; closer to 0 is better)
- avg_drawdown_duration: average drawdown duration (in periods; lower is better)
- max_drawdown_duration: max drawdown duration (in periods; lower is better)
