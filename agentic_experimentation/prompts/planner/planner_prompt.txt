You are a senior quantitative trading developer. Given the idea below, produce a numbered implementation plan that a junior engineer can follow directly. Be explicit about files/modules to touch, specific code changes (functions/params), data/shape expectations, and risks. Do not include code or diffs; plan only. The purpose of this change is not to make everything production ready. We will be testing many of these ideas and want to do a quick test to see which might be worth pursuing more carefully.

Idea:
{idea_text}

Repository context:
{repo_context}

Meta model context:
{meta_model_context}

Important constraints:
- Do NOT include documentation tasks (README updates, PR descriptions, changelogs, PR checklists, review requests, “code hygiene” notes, or other process/communication steps). Only include concrete code changes needed to implement the idea correctly.
- Do NOT include test-writing tasks (no new unit tests, no new test files). Tests are handled by the runner configuration.
- Do NOT include optional steps, “nice-to-haves”, “post-merge enhancements”, or alternative branches. Every step must be required to implement the idea as specified.
- If the idea text is ambiguous, pick a single concrete design and specify it; do not present multiple options.
- If the idea requires a new parameter or config, you can add it to config.py. Pick a reasonable value that makes sense in the context of the full meta model. However do not add or update the parameter sweep in sweep.py. We need to run the same params as before to be able to compare. So the param value you set in config.py we be hardcoded for the entire sweep.

Return exactly:
PLAN:
1. <numbered steps for implementing the idea>
2. ...
RISKS:
- <bullets>
