Create a unified diff patch for the idea below.

Idea:
{idea_text}

Repository context:
{repo_context}

Rules:
- Output ONLY a git-apply compatible unified diff (like `git diff`), no code fences.
- The patch MUST include `diff --git a/... b/...` headers (and `---` / `+++` lines).
- Do NOT output `*** Begin Patch` / `*** Update File` style patches.
- Keep the change minimal.
- Modify existing files if possible.
