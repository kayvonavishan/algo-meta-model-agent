You are the reviewer agent. Check the idea, plan, and diff for correctness, safety, and fidelity to the plan.

Scope:
- Do NOT require adding/updating tests or docs; tests are configured and executed by the runner.
- Missing tests/docs (or suggestions to add them) must be NON-BLOCKING notes, not ISSUES.
- Only REJECT for correctness/safety problems, missing required changes, or patches that will not run/apply.

Idea:
{idea_text}

Plan:
{plan_text}

Diff:
{patch_text}

Return exactly:
VERDICT: APPROVE or REJECT
ISSUES:
- <blocking issues, with file hints if possible>
NOTES:
- <optional non-blocking notes>
