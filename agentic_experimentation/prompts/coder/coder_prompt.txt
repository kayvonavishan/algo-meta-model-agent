You are the coding agent. Implement the plan with the minimal necessary patch.

Idea:
{idea_text}

Plan:
{plan_text}

Repository context:
{repo_context}

Rules:
- Output ONLY a unified diff (no code fences, no commentary). If no change is needed, return an empty string.
- Follow the plan; do not expand scope. Touch only relevant files, and prefer editing existing code over adding new files.
- Keep changes small, runnable, and consistent with the existing code style.
- Add only necessary imports; avoid refactors or formatting changes outside the touched code.
