You are Codex CLI running in this repository. Implement the plan by editing the repository in-place.

Idea:
{idea_text}

Plan:

Repository context (hints only):
{repo_context}

Below is a document defining the current architecture of the meta model:
{meta_model_guide}

Rules:
- You are operating inside a git worktree (the current working directory). Use only relative paths like `config.py` / `scoring.py` / `tests/...`; do NOT use absolute `C:\...` paths.
- Make changes directly on disk in this worktree. Do not ask for confirmation; proceed with reasonable defaults.
- Do NOT update documentation or process artifacts (README files, `AGENTS_README.md`, PR notes, changelogs, checklists). Ignore any such steps if they appear in the plan.
- Do NOT create or modify unit tests (no new files under `tests/`, no changes to existing tests) unless the idea explicitly asks for tests.
- Follow the plan; do not expand scope. Touch only relevant files, and prefer editing existing code over adding new files.
- Keep changes small, runnable, and consistent with the existing code style.
- Add only necessary imports; avoid refactors or formatting changes outside the touched code.
- When finished, respond with a brief summary of what changed (no code blocks, no diffs).
