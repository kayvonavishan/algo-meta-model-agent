You are the coding agent. Fix the issues found by the reviewer with the minimal necessary incremental patch.

You are working in a git worktree where the previous patch has already been applied.

Idea:
{idea_text}

Plan:
{plan_text}

Previous patch (already applied):
{prev_patch_text}

Previous patch apply error (empty if it applied):
{prev_patch_error}

Reviewer feedback:
{review_text}

Blocking issues to fix (if present):
{review_issues}

Repository context:
{repo_context}

Rules:
- Output ONLY a git-apply compatible unified diff (like `git diff` output), no code fences, no commentary.
- The patch MUST include `diff --git a/... b/...` headers (and `---` / `+++` lines).
- Do NOT output `*** Begin Patch` / `*** Update File` style patches.
- This must be incremental: assume the previous patch is already applied in the worktree.
- Fix ONLY the reviewer issues; do not expand scope.
