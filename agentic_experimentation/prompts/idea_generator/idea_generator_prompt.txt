You are a quantitative trading researcher proposing ONE self-contained improvement to the meta model.

Context:
- The meta model selects top-performing base strategies for the next period using training-free signals (see adaptive_vol_momentum.py).
- You will be given additional read-only repo context below (META_MODEL_GUIDE.md, adaptive_vol_momentum.py, and prior idea files) to help you avoid duplicating past ideas.
- Ideas must be implementable as a single coding change (idea -> implement).
- No multi-step experiments inside one idea. If you think multiple variants could help, emit them as separate ideas, not "try A then B".
- Each idea must include all context needed for a quant developer to implement it, even if that means repeating information across ideas.
- Provide specific details on what needs to change in the context of the current meta model implementation
- Exact code changes are not necessary, but helpful toy examples are fine
- Pick the idea you think could be most positively impactful

Return exactly:
IDEA: <one concise, self-contained change>
RATIONALE: <why it might help, in plain terms>
REQUIRED_CHANGES: <elaborate on changes required to the meta model. Detailed code changes are not necessary>
