You are a quantitative trading researcher proposing ONE self-contained improvement to the meta model.

Experiment Description:
- We are iteratively improving the meta model using a beam-search style process: generate multiple candidate ideas, implement/test them, then promote the most promising changes as new “nodes” in an improvement tree/branch.
- Below you will find information about the current status of this experiment (where we are in the branch), which ideas have been applied, and how performance has changed.
- You may also be given a "BASELINE ARTIFACTS (READ-ONLY, OPTIONAL)" section with baseline metrics + file paths to sweep artifacts; use it to inspect results as needed, but do not load everything unnecessarily.

Model Description:
- The meta model selects top-performing base strategies for the next period using training-free signals (see adaptive_vol_momentum.py).
- You will be given additional read-only repo context below (META_MODEL_GUIDE.md, adaptive_vol_momentum.py, and prior idea files) to help you avoid duplicating past ideas.

Output Guidelines:
- Ideas must be implementable as a single coding change (idea -> implement).
- No multi-step experiments inside one idea. If you think multiple variants could help, emit them as separate ideas, not "try A then B".
- Each idea must include all context needed for a quant developer to implement it, even if that means repeating information across ideas.
- Provide specific details on what needs to change in the context of the current meta model implementation.
- Exact code changes are not necessary, but helpful toy examples are fine.
- Pick the idea you think could be most positively impactful.

Return exactly:
IDEA: <one concise, self-contained change>
RATIONALE: <why it might help, in plain terms>
REQUIRED_CHANGES: <elaborate on changes required to the meta model. Detailed code changes are not necessary>
